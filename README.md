This artifact was part of CS-320’s MobileApplication assignment. This course covered testing automation in programming. I originally wrote this code in Java and utilized JUnit testing to check for accuracy of all of the functions. I wrote this program in early 2022 when I took this course and haven’t touched it since. The purpose was to ensure 100% test coverage using JUnit.

One of the possible ways to meet the requirement for a Software Design and Engineering enhancement was to convert a program into a different language and I found this exciting. I went through old assignments and found this one and thought it would be really neat to include it in my ePortfolio after converting it to C++. It shows my ability to understand key concepts of Object-Oriented programming by being able to use two different languages to accomplish the same tasks of creating/editing appointments, contacts, and tasks for an application. This showcases my ability to be able to remain flexible and change languages last minute without losing accuracy or capability. I was able to also demonstrate using completely different tools (C++ and CLion) to accomplish the same task. This time, I included a main function to run my code and demonstrate that it all works. This was not in scope of the original assignment.

This assignment does meet the original course objectives I set out to meet in this enhancement. In this enhancement, I demonstrate using innovative skills and techniques for implementing design solutions and accomplishing goals and I demonstrate the ability to address potential design flaws related to security.

Something I learned while modifying this code and transferring functionality from Java to C++ was the nuances between the two languages. They are similar in some ways and completely different in others. This assignment also taught me that programming concepts rule over knowing the ins and outs of a language. Once you understand a concept, you can use your resources and documentation  to figure out how to do something in another language. One challenge I faced was just getting started. I had to brush up on my C++ skills. Luckily, I have used C++ throughout this program so it was easy to look back at other assignments to see how I did things like classes and functions. It made implementation very easy once I got going. The code was also very similar for appointments, contacts, and tasks so once I had one down, the remaining ones were easy to complete.

Sorting Algorithm to traverse BST in Reverse Order:

This artifact is project two from the CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms course. In this project, we load course information from a .txt file into a Binary Search Tree and then perform sorting algorithms and search functions on the nodes of the BST. My enhancement to this artifact is an algorithm that conducts a sort of the BST in reverse alphabetic order. I am including this artifact in my ePortfolio because I believe that it demonstrates fundamental understanding of how essential algorithms are built and how they can be used with a BST. Additionally, I utilize the concept of recursion to call the algorithm multiple times within itself to achieve the desired result. I am excited to be able to show knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and recursion all in a simple, effective program like this one.

I meet the course objectives that I intended to meet with this artifact enhancement. I believe I even exceed them by utilizing recursion in my algorithm as well. This is a useful enhancement that shows an understanding of potential user requirements that is useful in the field of computer science where you are developing to a customer’s needs. In this instance, there was no way to sort the courses from Z to A. I added this functionality because if there is a database of 300 courses, you might want to have that capability. I also utilize secure coding practices by having a private inReverseOrder() function and a public InReverseOrder() function that calls on inReverseOrder() to perform the sort. This further shows my ability to execute efficient, secure coding to perform a function.

When I initially set out to enhance this artifact, I was nervous that writing this algorithm would be challenging. I decided to think about my problem and did a search online for how to implement a reverse sort on a BST. I was able to read about different ways it can be implemented and was happy to see that it was very similar to an in order sort like that one that already existed in my code. The biggest challenge was trying to figure out what exactly I was trying to do with the reverse sort. I was certainly rusty on the lessons taught in CS-300 so this was a great reintroduction to the concepts and I found myself quickly able settle in and code what was needed to add the desired enhancement.
